=======

This project is to catch up with latest Spring features and improvements, and use Spring MVC, REST service, Web Flow, Security, Apache Tile, and Thymeleaf.

The main features are:

-- replace most XML configuration files with JavaConfig for better maintenance

-- keep only XML file as descritor to Webflow, which reasonably gives a better understanding for business processes

-- using multiple methods in JPA queries, which is flexible to meet various business requirements and be effective in programming

-- show a set of viewing technologies compared to JSP, which is light weight and less invasive for front end development.

Guide to use:

1. download with "git clone 'this git project URL'" to loacal drive

2. use command line tool: mvn package

3. it is recommended to import to Spring IDE (Eclipse, STS etc.)
